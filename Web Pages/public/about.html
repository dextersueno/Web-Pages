<h1>About Me: Dexter K. Sueno</h1>
<p>Hi there! My name is Dexter Sueno, and I am a student at Kings College of the Philippines who loves learning about computers and how to make cool software. I got interested in technology because I wanted to know how websites and apps are created. I have learned some basic skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which are used for like the building blocks for making web pages. I have also started learning Java and Python, which are two programming languages that help me create even more interesting projects. I am excited to keep learning and improving my skills.</p>
<br>
<p></p>As I study, I would like to work on small projects where I can use what I have learned. For example, I enjoy making my own website, application, or a simple game. It feels great to see my ideas come to life and I think it’s important to practice and work with my classmates, that’s why I often join coding challenges and group projects. My goal is to learn how to create both the parts of a website that people see (front-end) and the parts that work behind the scenes (back-end) so I can make fun and useful apps.</p>
<br>
<p></p>During my vacant time, I play online games to relax and have fun with my friends such as Mobile Legends. Gaming helps me to unwind, relax and also teaches me how to work as a team. I also love going on adventures with my friends to explore different places in Baguio and Benguet and I enjoy hiking, visiting local markets, and just enjoying the beautiful nature around us. I believe that technology can help us in our daily lives making me excited to see how new inventions such as smart devices and helpful applications that will make our lives even better in the future. My dream is to become a great developer who not only knows a lot about technology but also enjoys life and shares my love for it with others.</p>
